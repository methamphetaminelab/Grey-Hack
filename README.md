# Grey-Hack
just my scripts for Grey Hack

## hackAll
> scans for `"init.so", "net.so", "kernel_module.so", "aptclient.so", "kernel_router.so"` vulnerabilities and connects to the target through the found one

## soDumper
> scans for library vulnerabilities and dumps the found ones into a file

## crackMails
> using previously discovered vulnerabilities, steal email addresses from target

## hack
> automatically hack the target and can dump vulnerabilities if needed
